<p>How the GIOPS 10 day forecasts are derived.
<ul>
<li>For 2D, the first four time steps (003, 006, 009, 012) are taken from the 00 and 12 simulation runs and combined to create combined to create the 10 day forecast.</li>
<li>For 3D, the first five 24 hour time steps (024, 048, 072, 096, 120) from the 00 and 12 simutation runs and combined to create the 10 day forecast.</li>
</ul>
