The Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) carries out physics calculations to arrive at deterministic predictions of atmospheric elements from the current day out to 10 days into the future. 
Atmospheric elements include temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, humidity and others.
This product contains raw numerical results of these calculations. 
Geographical coverage is global. Data is available at horizontal resolutions of 25 km and 66 km. Data is available for 28 vertical levels.
The winds and ice are available hourly from the IAU (incremental analysis update) cycle of the GDWPS G2 run. 
The GDWPS pseudo-analysis is executed four times a day for 6 hourscentred at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC. 
Each pseudo-analysis retrieves initial conditions by reading a restart file, 
which was written at the end of the previous pseudo-analysis, and so it is a smooth continuation of the previous run. 
The forecast is executed twice per day. 
The initial conditions of the 00 UTC forecast come from the previous day's 18 UTC pseudo-analysis, 
and the initial conditions of the 12 UTC forecast come from the 06 UTC pseudo-analysis. 
In order to bridge the 3-hour gap from the end of the pseudo-analysis to 
the availability of the GDWPS G1 run, the G1 IAU data is used.<br/><br/>
