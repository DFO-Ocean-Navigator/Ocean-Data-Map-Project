		<tr><td colspan="2">The Regional Deterministic Prediction System Coupled over the Gulf of St. Lawrence (RDPS-CGSL) provides analyses and 48 hr forecasts of atmospheric, ice and ocean conditions over the Gulf of St. Lawrence every 6 hours. The atmospheric model uses a 10 km resolution grid while the ice-ocean model uses a 5 km resolution grid. RDPS-CGSL is initialized using atmospheric analyses from the 10 km resolution Regional Deterministic Prediction System together with ice and ocean analyses produced using a data assimilation system that combines model estimates with RADARSAT image analyses produced by the Canadian Ice Service.</td></tr>
