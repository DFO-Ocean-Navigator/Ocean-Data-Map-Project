    SalishSeaCast NEMO Model -

    <p>
      3d SMELT biological model field values averaged over 1 hour intervals from
      SalishSeaCast NEMO model runs with physics, biology and chemistry. The
      values are calculated for the entire model grid that includes Juan de Fuca
      Strait, the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and Johnstone Strait on the
      coasts of Washington State and British Columbia. The time values are UTC.
      They are the centre of the intervals over which the calculated model
      results are averaged.
