    <h4>Speed of Sound [m/s]</h4>
    <p>
      The speed of sound is the distance [meter] travelled per unit of time
      [second] by a sound wave as it propagates through water.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Sonic layer Depth [m]</h4>
    <p>
      Depth of the maximum speed of sound that is higher in the water column
      than the critical depth. No value where deep sound channel axis does not
      exist.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Sound Channel Axis [m]</h4>
    <p>
      Depth of the global minimum in the speed of sound. No value if minimum is
      at the surface.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Critical Depth [m]</h4>
    <p>
      Second depth where the speed of sound is equal to the speed at the sonic
      layer depth. In the application we used a nearest neighbour interpolation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Technical note: Due to computer rounding errors, this calculation will
      select two points within a small tolerance range.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Depth Excess [m]</h4>
    <p>
      Difference between the Critical Depth and the ocean bottom as specified by the dataset's bathymetry. 
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Potential Subsurface Sound Channel</h4>
    <p>
      This variable represents the potential existence of a sub-surface sound
      channel. Selecting this variable will yield 0 or 1, where 0 means a
      sub-surface sound channel does not exist, 1 means a sub-surface sound
      channel potentially exists.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Other Derived Variables</h2>
    <br />

    <h4>Potential temperature [&deg;C]</h4>
    <p>
      Where source potential temperature is variable in degrees Kelvin we
      convert to Celsius with the following equation, C=K-273.15
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Water Velocity Magnitude [m/s]</h4>
    <p>
      Water velocity is calculated using the variables water east velocity [m/s]
      and water north velocity [m/s] as input.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Water Velocity Bearing [&deg;]</h4>
    <p>
      Water velocity is calculated using the variables water east velocity [m/s]
      and water north velocity [m/s] as input.
