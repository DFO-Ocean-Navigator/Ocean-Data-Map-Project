SalishSeaCast NEMO Model - <a href="https://salishsea.eos.ubc.ca/nemo/" target="_new">https://salishsea.eos.ubc.ca/nemo/</a>
<p>4d salinity and water temperature field values averaged over 1 hour intervals from SalishSeaCast NEMO model runs with physics, biology and chemistry. The values are calculated for the surface of the model grid that includes Juan de Fuca Strait, the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and Johnstone Strait on the coasts of Washington State and British Columbia. The time values are UTC. They are the centre of the intervals over which the calculated model results are averaged.</p>
