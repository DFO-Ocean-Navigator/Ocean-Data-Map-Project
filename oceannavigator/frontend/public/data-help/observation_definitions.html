    <h2>Ocean Observation</h2>
    <p>
      There are two ways to access ocean observation in the Ocean Navigator:
      global in-situ observation from global databases and CLASS4.
    </p>

    <h4>Global Ocean</h4>

    <p>
      Observation Ocean observation from various platforms will be available to
      compare with ocean prediction systems. This includes ARGO, glider,
      drifters, tagged animals and oceanographic missions. Currently, we are
      providing 2022 ARGO data from the
      <a href="http://en.data.ifremer.fr/pdmi/portalssearch/main"
        >IFREMER database</a
      >.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>CLASS4 Datasets</h4>
    <p>
      There are various global ocean prediction systems available to describe
      the physical and biological environments. The information from these
      systems are predicted estimates of the environmental variables which are
      valuable for users of the ocean. It is important to have metrics in place
      to validate these estimates. In physical oceanography there have been
      several metrics developed including the CLASS 4 metric. CLASS4 are created
      when forecast and analysis fields are interpolated to in-situ ocean
      observations at particular locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have two CLASS4 datasets available in the Ocean Navigator: OceanPredict
      and RIOPS Assimilated Observation. The OceanPredict CLASS4 is generated
      daily. Participating parties contribute by adding the model equivalent to
      an ocean observation for variables collected at a particular location. The
      CLASS4 file is then made available on the USGODAE website. The RIOPS
      Assimilated Observation data are based on the data assimilated into the
      Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System 1/12Â° (RIOPS). The in situ ocean
      observations are a result of the QC and thinning process applied to in
      situ data from CORIOLIS. A description of the data product can be found on
      the CMEMS website (reference below).
